### Case
![](./case_1.jpg)

### In the case of linked list, MaciDSAViz’s output closely aligns with the underlying logic, accurately representing pointer updates during insertion. In contrast, EHRAgent misleads users by incorrectly visualizing the relationships between front and rear pointers.

###  In the case of DFS, MaciDSAViz provides a clear and accurate visualization of the traversal process, effectively tracking the visited nodes. However, EHRAgent overlooks the representation of visited status, resulting in an incomplete or misleading depiction of the algorithm’s behavior
